## React Dynamic Tree with React Flow

This React project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic tree structure using the powerful React Flow library. It enables you to add, remove, and manipulate nodes visually, fostering a user-friendly experience.


Features:
Dynamic Node Creation: Users can add new nodes at any level of the tree, offering flexibility.
Interactive Expansion/Collapse: Nodes can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide nested children, improving organization and navigation.
Customizable Node Content: Tailor the content displayed within each node to suit your specific data and requirements.
Lightweight and Efficient: The project is designed to be performant, ensuring smooth operation even with large tree structures.
Visual Node Manipulation (React Flow): Leverage drag-and-drop functionality to create connections between nodes, visualize relationships, and manage the tree structure intuitively.

Getting Started

Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en

Clone the Repository:

Bash

    git clone git@github.com:whitewolf2000ani/tree-app.git

Install Dependencies:

Bash

    cd tree-app
    npm install react-flow (or yarn add react-flow)
    npm install (or yarn install)

Start the Development Server:

Bash

    npm run start (or yarn start)

This will launch the development server, typically running at http://localhost:3000 by default. Open this URL in your browser to view the dynamic tree with React Flow integration.

Usage

The project provides a DynamicTree component that you can integrate into your React application. You can customize the component's behavior and appearance by passing props. Here's an example:

JavaScript
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactFlow, { Elements } from 'react-flow'; // Import React Flow
    import DynamicTree from './DynamicTree'; // Import your custom DynamicTree component

    const data = [
    // Your tree data structure here, e.g.,
    {
        id: 1,
        label: 'Root Node',
        children: [
        { id: 2, label: 'Child Node 1' },
        { id: 3, label: 'Child Node 2', children: [...] },
        ],
    },
    ];

    const App = () => {
    const [elements, setElements] = useState([]); // Manage elements for React Flow

    const onNodeAdded = (newNode) => {
        // Handle adding a new node
        setElements((prevElements) => [...prevElements, newNode]);
    };

    const onNodeRemoved = (nodeId) => {
        // Handle removing a node
        setElements((prevElements) => prevElements.filter((el) => el.id !== nodeId));
    };

    return (
        <div>
        <DynamicTree data={data} onNodeAdded={onNodeAdded} onNodeRemoved={onNodeRemoved} />
        <ReactFlow elements={elements} onElementsChange={setElements} />
        </div>
    );
    };

    export default App;

Replace the data prop with your own tree data structure and implement the onNodeAdded and onNodeRemoved functions to handle user interactions within the DynamicTree component. These functions should update the elements state variable, which controls the elements displayed in the React Flow component.

Additional Customization

Node Styling: Customize the appearance of nodes using CSS classes.
Custom Node Components: Create custom components to render different types of nodes with varying functionalities.
Event Handling: Implement event handlers to capture user interactions with the tree and React Flow elements.
Further Development

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex interactive tree structures with React Flow. Here are some potential enhancements:
Drag-and-Drop Connections: Refine the connection logic to seamlessly connect nodes within React Flow based on user interactions.
Edge Styling: Customize the appearance of connections between nodes.
Node Labels: Allow users to edit node labels directly within React Flow.
